        <p>Happy to see my fan(s?) here! With the time goes, I have written some about some interesting things during the trip. However, due to my eccentricity of pursuing some extreme perfect on aesthtics. I decided to revise them and try it arrange them in a more eye-catching way. So sorry for my readers, もしわけござなる！</p>
<h3 id="30th-Sept"><a href="#30th-Sept" class="headerlink" title="30th Sept"></a>30th Sept</h3><hr>
<p>I had no idea about what we had done yesterday night, especially what we played, on condition that we were all drunk seriously. In the morning, nono got up very early in that she gonna go to the company. And I saw her very offcial dressing, kind of kakkoii(Sorry for no pictures, I should have taken it!) What about me? hmm.. sleeping in the bed till about 10am.</p>
<p>After getting up, seeing the foods nono make for me, I am totally moved…..How nice she is!（I cannot praise her more, so that is enough) After finishing the meal, I was very reluctant to wash them, more willing to leave them alone and sleep again, but I do not want to spend rest of the day on the roadway…</p>
<p>Nono was back at noon, while I was writing homework for killing time(I hate studying). She has classes in the afternoon, so it would better for us to eating lunch in her university,  the University of Tokyo, at Komaba Campus.</p>
<p>The dining hall was awesome, why? Because its awesomeness. I really liked the atmosphere in the hall where is bright and clean, filled with students sitting in a group and chatting. That is the life in university!</p>
<p>Campus in Komaba is for low grade(Freshmen) students who are excited and curious about the college life. When I was walking around, I ca see some practising dancing(in a sudden), hearing the voice of saxophone, doing exerising in the Gym, just totally involved what they keen on. I can feel school’s respect of all the students hobbies and students’ ardor of trying new things.</p>
<p>The real intention to write a lot above, was to dilute my failure on shooting games, I must admitted her shooting skills is outstanding to some extent.</p>
<p>After class, we met at Meidaimae and then we headed to Shinjuku, which was my first choice of the city in Japan. Why? I have many unforgetable memories here and it has many departments and restaurants, very prosperious state combining with some Adult only store, I did not know why children cannot get in though, that was unfair!</p>
<p>We went to one of the biggest bookstore here, it is called kinokuniya? And for satisfied her wish of eating kaoya, we went to one luxurious chinese restaurants called Tokyodaihenden here. To tell the truth, I think XX NO.1 can beat on the taste of every dishes I ordered and I promise to her I gonna let her eat kaoya in a version of betterment when she comes to China. Japanese awareness of seperation ubiquitously exist, even on the dining table. </p>
<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Nono the ‘Kaicho’ invited me to Japan when I was in Berkeley with her, so I planned and prepared the whole trip for a long time. Finally I am going to take off to Japan, though I suffered a lot from preparing material for visa.(due to my dilatory merit<strong>.x.</strong>)</p>
<p>It is the third time I have come to Japan. The first time was in my elementary school, when I was a little kid, I went to Hiroshima and Fukuoka, as a member of a kinder culture exchange activity (It was about 书法, at that time I was VERY good at it). I also took part in the memorial activity of atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima.</p>
<p>And the second time, when I was in sophomore, I took part in a short time travelling project which was organized by a company and Waseda University. Together with other people, I went to Tokyo, then Yokohama, Hakone, Kyoto and Osaka. I spent very very unforgetable time and met many kind friends during the trip.</p>
<p>Let’s get to the point, This time I made a very bold choice: <strong>Take plane in the midnight</strong>. The most crucial reason is that I want to try ANA’s airplane, because I heard the company has top-class service and also delicious food :P. But it came out to be very expensive (partly because too many chinese people will go to Japan during the holiday). So as a poor student, I had to choose a less expensive flight that was to fly at midnight.</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/usImTos.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>The airplane…</em> </center>


<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Episode:</strong> There was a fraudulent message send to me when I just arrived the airport. It said  I did not pay for the ticket and my ticket had been cancelled! </p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VBIkM9k.jpg" height="400" width="600">  <br><br><em>eating at that time though…</em><br></center>

<p>I was very surprised cuz I did not know what should I say to nono if I cannot go to Japan just before the day I should leave. So I asked for help to my mom, and she was surprised too. However, she contacted with officials<br>and verified my ticket had been paid, and then we realized it was sent by frauds. I was relieved and just want to say..</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/1pBuwo3.png" height="500" width="300"><br><strong>**</strong> </center>

<p>After finishing Check-in, and waiting, waiting and<br>finally, time is up!</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/tIq7w8s.jpg" height="400" width="600"> </center>

<p><em>To be continued…..</em><br><br></p>
<h3 id="28th-Sept"><a href="#28th-Sept" class="headerlink" title="28th Sept"></a>28th Sept</h3><hr>
<p>ANA airlane’s service really matches the price. It is acknowledged widely that Japanese people are very friendly to others, even though they may encounter many barriers like language. And I impressed a lot about their food, too. Btw, I was sitting between two Japanese, stressful..</p>
<p><br><br>Safely landed! Then I need to submit two forms, and I ask some details to an American. Though some information is not very accurate, I passed the inspection and seemed nothing bad happened till now. Henceforth, I went out of the gate, waiting for a few seconds, wild nono comes out! Finally, no more grey Berkeley hoodie, her dressing is pretty impressive to me.x.<br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dGhEDxc.jpg" height="600" width="400"><br><br><br><em>sorry for mosaic, it is privacy</em></center>

<p>Then we got to her house in Eifukucho, She said she gonna go to work from 9am to 7pm, that means I<br>will have a long free time……Okay. Then after she went out, I took many photos of her room. Due to privacy protection, I can only post a few of them…</p>
<p><br>  </p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VlznscE.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>Outside of her room…</em> </center>

<p><br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BZYS8Sh.jpg" height="500" width="400"> <center> <em>Give me a tissue</em> </center></center>

<p><br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/GQGmZBc.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>Books…sugoi..</em> </center>

<p>After tosatsu, I felt tired and drowsy.. and then I sleeeeeep… When I got up, I found that there are two things I need to buy.<br><br>(1) <strong>Plug</strong>: The shape of plug in Japan is quite different from China’s.(Solved by Amazon)<br><br>(2) <strong>Paper Clip</strong>: Nono bought a new SIM card but I cannot take out my old card without some tools to poke it out.(Solved by 7eleven) <br></p>
<p>But actually, I did not get them till night, after I got up, I ask nono to where to buy the plug. She recommand Shibuya so I went here. But I went around here, checked some departments like Labi, Big Camera and some little shops, none had the plug I want. I felt very disappointed… Good news is I bought the paper clips successfully, And one of the clerk is Chinese, ha.<br></p>
<p>Nono said She wanted to met me at Shimo-kitazawa (Shimo-kita or SK), So I went here. </p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/CVWJ4K4.jpg" height="600" width="600"> <br><br><em>Way to metro station, in Eifukucho</em> </center>

<p>Whoooops, I liked the atmosphere here very much, very animate and delicate. Many shops and restaurants, and traditional Japanese alley. She said Shimo-kitazawa is kind of young people’s town. Hmm, okay, though as an old man, I like here, too.<br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/DYiVIdX.jpg" height="500" width="400"> <center> <em>I should take more persuasive pictures..</em> </center></center>

<p>And we have dinner together. All Japanese menus make her and her cell phone struggle on explaining the meaning on dishes. And I ordered two cuz I really had little food during the whole day.</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/XneuE9k.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>the menu</em> </center>

 <center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aSR5Shf.jpg" height="400" width="400"><br><br><em>hungry, hungry</em></center>

<p><br><br>Then we went back home, study(Yes! S.T.U.D.Y) and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>P.S:</strong> Evidence for studying:</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/0msL7r5.jpg" height="600" width="600"> <br><br><em>studying…</em> </center>

<h3 id="29th-Sept"><a href="#29th-Sept" class="headerlink" title="29th Sept"></a>29th Sept</h3><hr>
<p>Early get up! Today I get up very early cuz we have many places to go. Finally $tourist$’s day comes!</p>
<p>After changing several metros, we get to the first place ‘<strong>Tsukiji</strong>‘. Tsukiji is famous for its market, there maybe one of the biggest transaction centers of seafood in the world. I knew here in that I watched some japanese food documentaries, which mentioned Tsukiji.</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/TVooVpF.jpg" height="400" width="400"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/H0An6Vu.jpg" height="400" width="400"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hDjkGvj.jpg" height="400" width="400"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mXKuK7h.jpg" height="400" width="400">  <br><br><em>Makkah for (sea)food lover’s</em> </center>

<p>I really want to try the fresh fish here, so we go to a restaurant for breakfast. I order a kind of 海鲜盖饭- -.I like the toro best cuz it tastes very smoothy and lean and fat combines perfectly. (btw it is the worthiest ingredient)</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/tUyU4OA.jpg" height="600" width="1000"><br><em>very delicious but expensive…</em> </center>

<p>As a foodie, it really galvanizes my appetite while walking on the street inside, but I somehow didn’t make any purchase. And Tsukiji also leaves me a very clean impression about japanese market, comparing to the market in China.</p>
<p>While Tsukiji is near Ginza, kind of shopping district, where roads are arranged like Manhattan in New York. So We head to Ginza as the next station. And we just walk around.</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/3YrnrBp.jpg" height="600" width="1000"><br><em>Cinema of famous kabuki Nakamura(I don’t know him though &lt;== why makes me think of liulaogen)</em> </center>

<p>After walking around sometime, we are going to go to the main destination – Edo Tokyo musuem.Firstly, I feel a little bit regretful about the ticket purchase. </p>
<p>I didn’t have any material to prove the student identity of me, that’s okay~ </p>
<p>Let an owl who has graduated several months ago to buy student ticket, that’s okay….?</p>
<p>But what I bought, a ticket which contains two shows including a special show, is not economic in that the special show is really expensive compared to the main show. You cannot do anything but watch in the special room, and two poor guys even sleep in the hall. And what I remember about the guy(I cannot even remember his name), main character of the exhibition, likes Japan very much.</p>
<p>But in all, I still trust in that every money you spend is worthy.</p>
<p>And when I move to the hall of main exhibition(out of the special zone), my old legs does not work well, someone makes fun of me and says ‘Ojiiiiiiisan’ to me. Okay, here is the bad guy.</p>

<p>btw, the station of museum is near the sudo arena, so there is a big sumo athelete in the metro station.</p>

<p>And we go to the Otoya for a late lunch(you can find it everywhere in Tokyo..), I almost die cuz food stuck in my throat, scary moment.. Then we again walking around in Ginza, I say to nono I gonna buy new shoes and she recommand us to go Shibuya, okay, at that time, I think as an ojiiiisan, I almost break down…</p>
<p>Still not buying anything, we back home eifukucho, then we have a small drinking competition in a restaurant nearby, btw, osake here is much better than I thought, very easy to drink and high-quality(though expensive). The result is <strong>I WIN</strong>!</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/a34QddI.jpg" height="600" width="1000"><br><em>That drink tastes great!</em> </center>

<p>Nono kaicho invited me to Japan when I was in Berkeley with her, so I planned and prepared the whole trip for a long time. and finally I am going to take off to Japan, though I suffered a lot from preparing material for visa.</p>
<p>It is the third time I came to japan. The first time was in elementary school, when I was a little kid, I went to Hiroshima and Fukuoka, as a member of a culture exchange activity (It is about 书法, at that time I was VERY good at it) I also took part in the memorial activity of atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima.</p>
<p>And the second time, when I was sophomore, I went to a project which was organized by a company and Waseda University. Together with other people, I went to Tokyo, and then Yokohama, Hakone, Kyoto and Osaka. I spent very very unforgetable time and met many kind friends during the trip.</p>
<p>Let’s get to the point, This time I made a very bold choice: <strong>Take plane in the midnight</strong>. The most crucial reason is that I want to try ANA’s airplane. Because I heard the company has top-class service and also delicious food :P. But it comes out to be very expensive (partly because too many chinese people will go to japan during the holiday). So as a poor student, I choose less expensive flight that is to fly at midnight.</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/usImTos.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>The airplane…</em> </center>


<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Episode:</strong> There was a fraudulent message send to me when I just arrived the airport. It said  I did not pay for the ticket and my ticket had been cancelled! </p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VBIkM9k.jpg" height="400" width="600"><br><br><em>eating at that time though…</em><br></center>

<p>I was very surprised cuz I did not know what should I say to nono if I cannot go to Japan just before the day I should leave. So I asked for help to my mom, and she was surprised too. However, she contacted with officials<br>and verified my ticket had been paid, and then we realized it was sent by frauds. I was relieved and just want to say..</p>

<p>After finishing Check-in, and waiting, waiting and<br>finally, time is up!</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/tIq7w8s.jpg" height="400" width="600"> </center>

<p><em>To be continued…..</em><br><br></p>
<h3 id="28th-Sept"><a href="#28th-Sept" class="headerlink" title="28th Sept"></a>28th Sept</h3><hr>
<p>ANA airlane’s service really matches the price. It is acknowledged widely that Japanese people are very friendly to others, even though they may encounter many barriers like language. And I impressed a lot about their food, too. Btw, I was sitting between two Japanese, stressful..</p>
<p><br><br>Safely landed! Then I need to submit two forms, and I ask some details to an American. Though some information is not very accurate, I passed the inspection and seemed nothing bad happened till now. Henceforth, I went out of the gate, waiting for a few seconds, wild nono comes out! Finally, no more grey Berkeley hoodie, her dressing is pretty impressive to me.x.<br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dGhEDxc.jpg" height="600" width="400"><br><br><br><em>sorry for mosaic, it is privacy</em></center>

<p>Then we got to her house in Eifukucho, She said she gonna go to work from 9am to 7pm, that means I<br>will have a long free time……Okay. Then after she went out, I took many photos of her room. Due to privacy protection, I can only post a few of them…</p>
<p><br>  </p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VlznscE.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>Outside of her room…</em> </center>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/GQGmZBc.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <em>Books…sugoi..</em> </center>

<p>After tosatsu, I felt tired and drowsy.. and then I sleeeeeep… When I got up, I found that there are two things I need to buy.<br><br>(1) <strong>Plug</strong>: The shape of plug in Japan is quite different from China’s.(Solved by Amazon)<br><br>(2) <strong>Paper Clip</strong>: Nono bought a new SIM card but I cannot take out my old card without some tools to poke it out.(Solved by 7eleven) <br></p>
<p>But actually, I did not get them till night, after I got up, I ask nono to where to buy the plug. She recommand Shibuya so I went here. But I went around here, checked some departments like Labi, Big Camera and some little shops, none had the plug I want. I felt very disappointed… Good news is I bought the paper clips successfully, And one of the clerk is Chinese, ha.<br></p>
<p>Nono said She wanted to met me at Shimo-kitazawa (Shimo-kita or SK), So I went here. </p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/CVWJ4K4.jpg" height="600" width="600"> <br><br><em>Way to metro station, in Eifukucho</em> </center>

<p>Whoooops, I liked the atmosphere here very much, very animate and delicate. Many shops and restaurants, and traditional Japanese alley. She said Shimo-kitazawa is kind of young people’s town. Hmm, okay, though as an old man, I like here, too.<br></p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/DYiVIdX.jpg" height="500" width="400"> <center> <em>I should take more persuasive pictures..</em> </center></center>

<p>And we have dinner together. All Japanese menus make her and her cell phone struggle on explaining the meaning on dishes. And I ordered two cuz I really had little food during the whole day.</p>

 <center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aSR5Shf.jpg" height="400" width="400"><br><br><em>hungry, hungry</em></center>

<p><br><br>Then we went back home, study(Yes! S.T.U.D.Y) and sleep.</p>
<p><strong>P.S:</strong> Evidence for studying:</p>

<h3 id="29th-Sept"><a href="#29th-Sept" class="headerlink" title="29th Sept"></a>29th Sept</h3><hr>
<p>Early get up! Today I get up very early cuz we have many places to go. Finally $tourist$’s day comes!</p>
<p>After changing several metros, we get to the first place ‘<strong>Tsukiji</strong>‘. Tsukiji is famous for its market, there maybe one of the biggest transaction centers of seafood in the world. I knew here in that I watched some japanese food documentaries, which mentioned Tsukiji.</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/TVooVpF.jpg" height="400" width="400"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/H0An6Vu.jpg" height="400" width="400"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hDjkGvj.jpg" height="400" width="400"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mXKuK7h.jpg" height="400" width="400">  <br><br><em>Makkah for (sea)food lover’s</em> </center>

<p>I really want to try the fresh fish here, so we go to a restaurant for breakfast. I order a kind of 海鲜盖饭- -.I like the toro best cuz it tastes very smoothy and lean and fat combines perfectly. (btw it is the worthiest ingredient)</p>
<center> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/tUyU4OA.jpg" height="600" width="1000"> <br><br><em>very delicious but expensive…</em> </center>

<p>As a foodie, it really galvanizes my appetite while walking on the street inside, but I somehow didn’t make any purchase. And Tsukiji also leaves me a very clean impression about japanese market, comparing to the market in China.</p>
<p>While Tsukiji is near Ginza, kind of shopping district, where roads are arranged like Manhattan in New York. So We head to Ginza as the next station. And we just walk around.</p>

<p>After walking around sometime, we are going to go to the main destination – Edo Tokyo musuem.Firstly, I feel a little bit regretful about the ticket purchase. </p>
<p>I didn’t have any material to prove the student identity of me, that’s okay~ </p>
<p>Let an owl who has graduated several months ago to buy student ticket, that’s okay….?</p>
<p>But what I bought, a ticket which contains two shows including a special show, is not economic in that the special show is really expensive compared to the main show. You cannot do anything but watch in the special room, and two poor guys even sleep in the hall. And what I remember about the guy(I cannot even remember his name), main character of the exhibition, likes Japan very much.</p>
<p>But in all, I still trust in that every money you spend is worthy.</p>
<p>And when I move to the hall of main exhibition(out of the special zone), my old legs does not work well, someone makes fun of me and says ‘Ojiiiiiiisan’ to me. Okay, here is the bad guy.</p>
